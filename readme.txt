The official DHL for WooCommerce plugin allows you to automate your e-commerce order process. Covering shipping services from DHL Paket (Germany and Austria), DHL Parcel (Benelux) and soon DHL Express (globally).


== Description ==

DHL’s official extension for WooCommerce on Wordpress. Manage your national and international shipments easily.  The “DHL for WooCommerce” – plugin is compatible with the following DHL service offerings depending on your origin country:
* DHL Paket (Germany)
* DHL Parcel (Benelux)
* Deutsche Post International (all European countries)
* DHL eCommerce Asia (AU, CN, HK, IN, VN, TH, SG, MY)

For all countries which are not mentioned here we are working on further enhancements which will be added soon. 


== Features ==

1. NEW: Ship your orders with **DHL Warenpost** in Germany.
1. Fast and easy **label creation** of your national and international orders.

1. Use **additional delivery services** as e.g. the visual check of age available via the API of DHL Paket or Cash on delivery in selected countries. 
1. Offer **Preferred Delivery Options** to your customers via “Wunschpaket”. The customer has the opportunity to select a specific time and date for his delivery or an alternative delivery location e.g. his preferred neighbour.
1. **Customization** Enable/disable or edit the names of services and set up the handling cost for each DHL shipping service.
1. Experience **premium support**, timely compatibility updates and bug fixes.
1. The **“print only if codeable”** – option you can activate in the DHL settings will check whether the address is correct or not before generating the label.
1. **Bulk Label Creation** allows you to create multiple DHL Labels at once. 
1. **Return Parcel Handling** allows you to print a return label with a “return address” so your customer can return the shipment easily. 
1. **For Parcel Benelux**, this plugin has certified compatibility with WMPL that enables you to leverage multilingual capabilities. Click [here](https://wpml.org/plugin/dhl-for-woocommerce-2/) for further information.
